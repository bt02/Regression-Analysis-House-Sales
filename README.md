Between low-end house (condition 1&2) and high-end (condition 3,4, &5) subgroups there is little difference in average sale price. The jump from condition 2 to 3 is a $150,000 change. However, maintenance and overall satisfaction of the recurring buyer would justify buying up to higher-end house. Within the high-end subgroups condition 4 has the lowest price followed closely by condition 3, and would be the target as to not go too overbudget with condition 5

The above chart is a specific representation of only houses that meet the condition 4 criteria. Data overtime displays that the housing market is increasing, and new built houses will cost the most. With cost efficiency in mind houses built in the 1960 offer the cheapest price ideally without being culturally out of date.

When looking at houses Seattle and Bellevue have the highest prices with location to the city and waterfront availability driving up prices drastically. Cheaper alternatives are seen largely in southern King County. The graph dots size and color are representative of their cost and all depict a condition 4 house made in the 1960. If the buyer is looking for waterfront availability, Des Moines offer ideal locations for the price. With that if location is an issue, Renton closer to the larger cities like Seattle while still having competitive house prices.
